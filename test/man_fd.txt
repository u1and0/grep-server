FD(1)                                             General Commands Manual                                             FD(1)

NAME
       fd - find entries in the filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       fd [-HIEsiaLp0hV] [-d depth] [-t filetype] [-e ext] [-E exclude] [-c when] [-j num] [-x cmd] [pattern] [path...]

DESCRIPTION
       fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find(1).

OPTIONS
       -H, --hidden
              Include  hidden  files  and  directories  in  the  search  results (default: hidden files and directories are
              skipped).

       -I, --no-ignore
              Show search results from files and directories that would otherwise be ignored by .gitignore, .ignore, .fdig‐
              nore, or the global ignore file.

       -u, --unrestricted
              Alias for '--no-ignore'. Can be repeated; '-uu' is an alias for '--no-ignore --hidden'.

       --no-ignore-vcs
              Show search results from files and directories that would otherwise be ignored by .gitignore files.

       -s, --case-sensitive
              Perform  a  case-sensitive search. By default, fd uses case-insensitive searches, unless the pattern contains
              an uppercase character (smart case).

       -i, --ignore-case
              Perform a case-insensitive search. By default, fd uses case-insensitive searches, unless the pattern contains
              an uppercase character (smart case).

       -g, --glob
              Perform a glob-based search instead of a regular expression search.

       --regex
              Perform a regular-expression based seach (default). This can be used to override --glob.

       -F, --fixed-strings
              Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression.

       -a, --absolute-path
              Shows the full path starting from the root as opposed to relative paths.

       -l, --list-details
              Use a detailed listing format like 'ls -l'. This is basically an alias for '--exec-batch ls -l' with some ad‐
              ditional 'ls' options. This can be used to see more metadata, to show symlink targets and to achieve a deter‐
              ministic sort order.

       -L, --follow
              By  default,  fd  does  not descend into symlinked directories. Using this flag, symbolic links are also tra‐
              versed.

       -p, --full-path
              By default, the search pattern is only matched against the filename (or directory name). Using this flag, the
              pattern is matched against the full path.

       -0, --print0
              Separate search results by the null character (instead of newlines). Useful for piping results to xargs.

       --max-results count
              Limit the number of search results to 'count' and quit immediately.

       -1     Limit the search to a single result and quit immediately. This is an alias for '--max-results=1'.

       --show-errors
              Enable the display of filesystem errors for situations such as insufficient permissions or dead symlinks.

       --one-file-system, --mount, --xdev
              By default, fd will traverse the file system tree as far as other options dictate. With this flag, fd ensures
              that it does not descend into a different file system than the one it started in. Comparable to the -mount or
              -xdev filters of find(1).

       -h, --help
              Print help information.

       -V, --version
              Print version information.

       -d, --max-depth d
              Limit directory traversal to at most d levels of depth. By default, there is no limit on the search depth.

       --min-depth d
              Only show search results starting at the given depth. See also: '--max-depth' and '--exact-depth'.

       --exact-depth d
              Only  show  search  results  at  the exact given depth. This is an alias for '--min-depth <depth> --max-depth
              <depth>'.

       -t, --type filetype
              Filter search by type:

              f, file
                     regular files

              d, directory
                     directories

              l, symlink
                     symbolic links

              x, executable
                     executable (files)

              e, empty
                     empty files or directories

              s, socket
                     sockets

              p, pipe
                     named pipes (FIFOs)

              This option can be used repeatedly to allow for multiple file types.

       -e, --extension ext
              Filter search results by file extension ext.  This option can be used repeatedly to allow for multiple possi‐
              ble file extensions.

       -E, --exclude pattern
              Exclude  files/directories that match the given glob pattern.  This overrides any other ignore logic.  Multi‐
              ple exclude patterns can be specified.

       --ignore-file path
              Add a custom ignore-file in '.gitignore' format.  These files have a low precedence.

       -c, --color when
              Declare when to colorize search results:

              auto   Colorize output when standard output is connected to terminal (default).

              never  Do not colorize output.

              always Always colorize output.

       -j, --threads num
              Set number of threads to use for searching & executing (default: number of available CPU cores).

       -S, --size size
              Limit results based on the size of files using the format <+-><NUM><UNIT>

              '+'    file size must be greater than or equal to this

              '-'    file size must be less than or equal to this

              'NUM'  The numeric size (e.g. 500)

              'UNIT' The units for NUM. They are not case-sensitive.  Allowed unit values:

                     'b'    bytes

                     'k'    kilobytes (base ten, 10^3 = 1000 bytes)

                     'm'    megabytes

                     'g'    gigabytes

                     't'    terabytes

                     'ki'   kibibytes (base two, 2^10 = 1024 bytes)

                     'mi'   mebibytes

                     'gi'   gibibytes

                     'ti'   tebibytes

       --changed-within date|duration
              Filter results based on the file modification time. The argument can be provided as a specific point in  time
              (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) or as a duration (10h, 1d, 35min).  --change-newer-than can be used as an alias.

              Examples:
                --changed-within 2weeks
                --change-newer-than "2018-10-27 10:00:00"

       --changed-before date|duration
              Filter  results based on the file modification time. The argument can be provided as a specific point in time
              (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) or as a duration (10h, 1d, 35min).  --change-older-than can be used as an alias.

              Examples:
                --changed-before "2018-10-27 10:00:00"
                --change-older-than 2weeks

       -o, --owner [user][:group]
              Filter files by their user and/or group. Format: [(user|uid)][:(group|gid)]. Either side is optional. Precede
              either side with a '!' to exclude files instead.

              Examples:
                --owner john
                --owner :students
                --owner "!john:students"

       -x, --exec command
              Execute command for each search result. The following placeholders are substituted by a path derived from the
              current search result:

              {}     path

              {/}    basename

              {//}   parent directory

              {.}    path without file extension

              {/.}   basename without file extension

       -X, --exec-batch command
              Execute command with all search results at once.  A single occurence of the following placeholders is  autho‐
              rized and substituted by the paths derived from the search results before the command is executed:

              {}     path

              {/}    basename

              {//}   parent directory

              {.}    path without file extension

              {/.}   basename without file extension

PATTERN SYNTAX
       The regular expression syntax used by fd is documented here:

       ⟨https://docs.rs/regex/1.0.0/regex/#syntax⟩

       The glob syntax is documented here:

       ⟨https://docs.rs/globset/#syntax⟩

ENVIRONMENT
       LS_COLORS
              Determines how to colorize search results, see dircolors(1).

       XDG_CONFIG_HOME, HOME
              Used to locate the global ignore file. If XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set, use $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fd/ignore.  Otherwise,
              use $HOME/.config/fd/ignore.

EXAMPLES
       Find files and directories that match the pattern 'needle':
              $ fd needle

       Start a search in a given directory (/var/log):
              $ fd nginx /var/log

       Find all Python files (all files with the extention .py) in the current directory:
              $ fd -e py

       Open all search results with vim:
              $ fd pattern -X vim
